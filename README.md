### Eduscope Backend

#### Version change

* Create a new directory with version number as a name under db directory and copy previous version files as base and modify schema name in file `call.sql`. Or if bigger changes are planned, don't copy :)
* Modify `eduscope.php` under api directory and change schema name in variable `$dbschema`.
